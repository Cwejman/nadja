# Nadja Gustavsson

A website about Najda Gustavsson and her gardening service. She works in Sweden bohusl√§n and wants a website were poeplo can understand what type of gardening she does, prices and of course contact.

This site is a bit outdated especially behind the scenes. The goal is to rebuild it in a modern fashion this spring.

## Ingredients

Nadjas site is mostly responsive and uses Jade, SASS and Javascript with JQuery. JQuery covers the hiding of different div for navigation but will be moved to a more suited and faster framework, such as Angular. Jade and SASS is proccesed in development which gives the final site only html and css to work with.
